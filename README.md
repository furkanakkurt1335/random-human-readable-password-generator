# random-human-readable-password-generator

`wl.json` is created with entries in Merriam-Webster, restricted to the ones with more than 3 characters and only a-z or A-Z in them. It's been shuffled with `random`. The script uses `random.org` to select which words to use.

3 generated passwords for example:

- `leachability-restring-opisthodomos`
- `otter-trophotropic-gnathopoda`
- `whangdoodle-pittsburgh-betrim`
